# Some-Basic-Algorithms

Here are some basic Algorithms that I have coded in Python. These are elementry codes but I feel are exteremely important in order to build a solid grounding in ML.

An efficiently coded algorithm can reduce the running time exponentially and make everyone's life a little easier. 

The list will be updated periodically as and when I learn new things, Enjoy!
